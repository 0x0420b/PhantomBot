#Development Setup Guide
This guide is for the people that would like to contribute to PhantomBot and do it well. <3

Please have a read on [CODESTYLE.md](https://github.com/PhantomBot/PhantomBot/blob/master/CODESTYLE.md), any code that does not apply to these rules will not get merged.

##General (All other IDE's)
This section is for all IDE's not mentioned in this guide.  
It's very global, so you might need to take some extra steps to get it to work for you.

1. Fork the [PhantomBot repository](https://github.com/PhantomBot/PhantomBot).
2. Check out your for and open it in your favorite IDE.
2. Set the project Java SDK to [1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html).
3. Import `build.xml` into your [ANT](http://ant.apache.org/) task manager.
4. Setup your favorite JavaScript minifier to mangle & minify all sources from `./javascript-sources/` and have it put the output in `./resources/scripts/`.  
  *The most commonly used minifier is [UglifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js) with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).*

DONE! Happy coding <3

##JetBrains IntelliJ
This section also applies to JetBrains PHPStorm, wich is great for JavaScript, but lacks Java support.

1. Fork the [PhantomBot repository](https://github.com/PhantomBot/PhantomBot).
2. Open up IntelliJ, so you have the start screen.  
  From there you can check out (Check out from Version Control) your fork and open it up.
3. Open up a file from `./source/` where IntelliJ will ask you for a project SDK. Use SDK [1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html).
4. Next up mark the directories `./source` and `./javascript-source` as "Sources Root".  
  *"Mark Directory As" in the context menu.*
5. Install the "File Watchers" plugin if you haven't already.
6. Import `./development-resources/watchers.xml` into your File Watchers.  
  *The File Watchers are located in "Settings" under "Tools"*

DONE! Happy coding <3
